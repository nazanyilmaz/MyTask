<h1>MyTask</h1>
<p>
   I developed a MyTask project using the AsyncStorage data storage method. You can use this application without any problems on IOS and Android devices. You can add as many new tasks as you want. You will be able to manage the process by using the start-wait-completion-cancel or delete features of the added tasks.
   -React Navigation -
   Iconsax -
   UUID and AsyncStorage packages work without any problems.</p>
